1. Check for the preceeding - & + signs
2. Have a check for the position from where the digits start if no numerical values are available, return 0.
3. If there are digits present, start counting up until the point the digits stop following each other in succession
4. For every digit found, multiply it by the  place value of the digits available accordingly;this will happen in reverse with the multiplier being incremented by a multiple of 10
5. return the value alongside the resulting value of the preceeding sign
